In the Beginning was the Command Line

This is an essay written by Neal Stephenson available: 
<http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html>

I have taken it upon myself to make it available in a variety of formats.
Markdown, tex, PDF so far.
I will make an ebook soon.

I use pandoc to convert the markdown file into .tex,
and I will use the same tool to create the ebook when I get round to it.

I have not asked for permission to do this.
The text is freely available online,
and a similar project to reuse this essay was approved:

But let me just repeat that:
I have not recieved permission to do this.
However, the above linked page includes the
rather terse lisencing text:
"Reproduce at will, provided the credits remain".
I have not reproduced any of Garrett Birkel's text,
but the content here is copyright 1999 Neal Stephenson.
