In the Beginning was the Command Line

This is an essay written by Neal Stephenson available: 
<http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html>

I have taken it upon myself to make it available in a variety of formats.
Markdown, tex, PDF so far.
I will make an ebook soon.

I use pandoc to convert the markdown file into .tex,
and I will use the same tool to create the ebook when I get round to it.
